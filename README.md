Pet Fish Co.
You were requested to build a stock-taking application and API for Pet Fish
Co., a pet fish store. The store boasts a number of different types of
aquariums, each holding a certain amount of various types of fish.
Now, Pet Fish Co. wants to have a application to keep track of all of its
aquariums and their fish. They also want to have access to two endpoints:
one to create or update a fish, and one to retrieve all fish for a given
aquarium. But there’s a catch!
The following rules apply:
1. Aquariums can vary in glass type, size (litres), and shape.
2. Fish can vary in species, color, and number of fins.
3. Some fish can’t go with other fish or in certain aquariums. It's
important to unit test this.
1. Goldfish don’t go with guppies.
2. Fish with three fins or more don’t go in aquariums of 75 litres or
less.
Bonus points
If you want to go the extra mile: Pet Fish Co. is considering opening up a
store across the pond in the US. That means they’ll have to be able to convert
their aquarium size from litres to gallons. It’s up to you to find the best way
to do that! And of course, this needs to be unit tested.
